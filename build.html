    <h1>How I built this site</h1>
    <h3>TL;DR - HTML and CSS. Go ahead - turn off Javascript!</h3>
    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>I've worked on webapps my whole career. Sure, I got started as a teenager editing phpBB and using
        Dreamweaver, but once I got my degree and became a programmer, it's been webapps all the way.
        Not really intentionally - that's just how it panned out. And I'm glad! I really enjoy webapps.</p>
    <p>However, I've also always worked on products somebody else had written. And they'd always used some framework
        that we had to keep using. First it was a homebrewed framework built over years before I turned up, next it was
        Sencha 5+6, next it was Sencha 4. I'm literally regressing!</p>
    <p>To combat this, and bring some modernity to our Sencha 4 project, I started a new UI in React. We'll make
        new, dedicated UIs in React, taking a persona-focused approach. Instead of shoving everything onto a single
        page, now we're tailoring the experience so users don't see things they're not interested in.</p>
    <p>And React is great! It's fun, it reminds me of the good ol' days of writing websites. But, you know, better.</p>
    <p>But React is still JS. It has to download JS to render the page. Next.js is a great workaround for that, but
        (at work, at least) I don't fancy installing and maintaining a node runtime on our clients' servers.</p>
    <p>So instead, I wondered how fast I could make this site. How easy. How few build steps. How much can I
        achieve, with such a little amount?</p>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <h3>The Content Itself</h3>
    <p>Plain old HTML, with plain old CSS! HTML5 and CSS3 have been around for years, so I thought I'd give them a
        whirl. I spun up IntelliJ IDEA and created a new HTML5 project. I added two files: index.html and index.css
        . Add in some &lt;h1&gt;'s and some &lt;hr\&gt;'s (who else had forgotten they existed?!) and we're good to
        go. Day one, let's get this online, no fuss.</p>
    <h3>Getting Online</h3>
    <p>I've used AWS, and I've used Netlify, and I've used Apache Server and Apache Tomcat and I want the simplest
        things. So I made a <a href="https://github.com/grumpytechdude/this-is-alex">github repo</a>, pushed my one
        commit, and cracked open <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">netlify</a>.</p>
    <p>Four clicks. Once I'm signed in, it takes four clicks before they've hooked into my repo, downloaded the
        code, built the code (which I believe, in this instance, means "just load that whole directory there"), and
        given me an auto-generated url: <a href="https://frosty-ptolemy-5ac0b4.netlify.com/">https://frosty-ptolemy
            -5ac0b4.netlify.com/</a> You'll notice that's a https url too - not a http in sight!</p>
    <p>They even give you this badge you can stick anywhere, and it'll tell you if your site is building:
        <img loading="lazy" alt="Netlify Building Badge"
             src="https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/4bcf7b38-c9fd-4105-a671-8d9ab90f5ee8/deploy-status"/>
    </p>
    <p>After that, I pointed my <a href="https://alex-sinclair.dev">alex-sinclair.dev</a> domain at their
        name servers, they automatically provisioned a https certificate with Lets Encrypt, and now a site have I!</p>
    <h2>Statistics</h2>
    <p>Building a site with no JS is fun and all - but what's the point? Well, let's look at some pros!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Four seconds between pushing code, and it being live.</li>
        <li>No build steps, no Jenkins, nothin'.</li>
        <li>100/100 performance, accessibility, and best practice scores on lighthouse. <a
                href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Falex-sinclair.dev&tab=desktop">Check
            it for yourself!</a></li>
        <li>This website is almost an exercise in minimalism. It's honestly a real treat.</li>
        <li>It's easy. I've not had to think about so few things at once, almost ever.</li>
        <li>You can learn how I've done it by looking at the source code. Most websites have a tangled mess of
            auto-generated code that it's essentially impossible to learn from.
        </li>
        <li>I'm helping to save the planet. <a
                href="https://www.emergeinteractive.com/insights/detail/does-irresponsible-web-development-contribute-to-global-warming/">Data
            transfers use electricity</a>, and by not including tracking, or JS, or images, I keep my carbon
            footprint small. At the time of writing, index.html is 1.8KB, and index.css is 689B. That's 2500 bytes. I
            noticed Netlify was returning a 404 page for my favicon at 2KB, so by uploading a favicon I actually save
            bytes! Now it's 4 requests at 3.3KB transferred total.<br/>
            In Comparison, the google.com homepage makes 29 requests to load 439KB - to display 14 hyperlinks and a
            text box. And cnn.com makes 78 requests to load 2MB of data.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>There are downsides, however. Plenty of them!</p>
    <ol>
        <li>webhint.io shows <a href="https://webhint.io/scanner/2bf30aea-077f-4315-a77f-bbed270e6ebd">just how many
            things I'm not in control of</a>. Cache headers and cross-origin mostly. Netlify serves my content from
            their CDN, so apparently css comes from cloudfront.net. If I were running my own server, I could
            setup all sorts of delightful headers.
        </li>
        <li>Duplication! With a build system we can inline css files, or auto-import them. Here, I have to setup
            the same header for each page. It would be easy to change a header in one place, and not another, and
            introduce bugs.
        </li>
        <li>No Tests. Not having a build means I can't run tests. I mean, I can - but I'd have to put them
            somewhere else. Or I could move this content to a /public source folder, and serve that instead.
        </li>
        <li>This is highly unnecessary! <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Gatsby.js</a> combines your React with a
            CMS (or Markdown files) to render your site as static html. That aught to be just as fast as this little
            site.
        </li>
        <li>This site is dull. Boring. There's no interactivity; no flashing menus. I'd never advocate a site like
            this in a professional environment - but I think it's perfect for me, for now.</li>
    </ol>
