    <p>I enjoy reading. It's my primary hobby, if I had to pick one. You can find what I'm reading, if you're
        interested, on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49669264-alex-sinclair">goodreads</a>.</p>
    <p>I also like words! Etymology is fun.
        If you can learn the history of words, you can piece together what words should be when you don't know them.
        There's even folk etymology, for when words that sound related, but are not related, become related because
        people thought they were related.

    <p>I don't contribute to open source, and I don't really program in my spare time.
        Instead, I read books, spend time with my family and dog, play and run D&D, and cook!
        I'm passionate about each of these things, and I use the skills I learn elsewhere in my work.
        I'm just getting started woodworking, after loving it at school.</p>

    <h3>I've spent my professional career solving problems for companies.</h3>
    <p>First I made a database run much faster. This job was only SQL. </p>
    Then I worked in the networking space on a product that synchronised different Networking Management
    tools to automate network management. BT could turn up a port in 90 days. We could do it in 90 seconds.
    This job was:
    <ul>
        <li>Java</li>
        <li>Javascript</li>
        <li>SQL</li>
        <li>Jenkins</li>
        <li>Virtual Machine provisioning with Citrix XenCenter</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>WebObjects/Project Wonder</li>
        <li>BPM Process Engineering</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After two years of that fun, I worked on SalesForce for three years on software to recognise revenue.<br/>
        <!--            <a href="proud.html">Read about some of the cool stuff we achieved.</a>-->
        This job was:
    <ul>
        <li>SalesForce</li>
        <li>Apex (SalesForce's Language built atop Java) - Backend</li>
        <li>Javascript (Sencha 5/6) - Frontend</li>
        <li>Ruby (Capybara) - UI Testing</li>
        <li>Google Sheets (Sandwiches!)</li>
        <li>Agile Coach</li>
    </ul>
    It was in this job I discovered that programming wasn't just about programming - but people too. In fact,
    it often felt like it was more about people than it was about the keyboard.

    </p>
    <p>I took an offer I couldn't refuse. The sole technical person on a product in need of some love. It's a lot
        of responsibility, and a big challenge, but a heck of a lot of fun. Some examples of what we're doing:
    <ul>
        <li>Migrating from Sencha 4 to React</li>
        <li>Migrating from Java 8 to Kotlin</li>
        <li>Migrating from Selenium to Cypress</li>
        <li>Migrating from Xamarin to a Progressive Web App</li>
    </ul>
